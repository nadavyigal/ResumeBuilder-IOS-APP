# Project Progress

Project: ResumeBuilder iOS
Status: In Progress
Current Phase: Pre-release (TestFlight prep)
Active Story: —
Last Completed Story: rb-aso-002 — App Store screenshot renderer added and 5-slot English screenshot set exported for 6.7" and 6.5" iPhone sizes (2026-05-28)
Next Recommended Story: Upload rb-aso-002 screenshots to App Store Connect once an ASC API key/session is available, then confirm Privacy Policy and Support URLs
Estimated Completion: 68%
Blockers: `/api/v1/resumes` returns production Next.js 404 HTML; backend route must ship before Resume Library can be re-enabled
Risks: Swift 6 concurrency strictness; PDF render via WKWebView (fragile on real device); no Hebrew/RTL support; live backend endpoint gaps now surface real user-visible errors instead of mock fallback content; ExpertSavedReportDetailView's run-id mapping depends on backend returning run IDs in /expert-reports (not yet verified against live backend)
Last Validation: XcodeBuildMCP `build_run_sim` succeeded while rendering rb-aso-002 screenshots on iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator; screenshot PNGs exported at 1290x2796 and 1242x2688; `test_sim` passed 33/33 (2026-05-28). Previous Expert UX/design/timeout follow-up validation passed `test_sim` 55/55 and backend expert Jest contracts 24/24 (2026-05-26).

## Tab Structure (as of 2026-05-20)
| Tab | Index | View | VM |
|-----|-------|------|----|
| Tailor | 0 | TailorView | TailorViewModel (stable @State) |
| Optimized | 1 | OptimizedResumeTabView → OptimizedResumeView | OptimizedResumeViewModel (built from appState.latestOptimizationId) |
| Design | 2 | RedesignResumeView | DesignViewModel (stable @State) |
| Expert | 3 | ExpertTabView → ExpertModesView | ExpertModesViewModel (built from appState.latestOptimizationId) |
| Me | 4 | ProfileView (with inline applications) | — |

## Key Shared State
- `AppState.latestOptimizationId: String?` — persisted via UserDefaults; set on optimize success AND when opening Latest Resume from Me tab or View Optimized Resume from Application Detail; drives Optimized+Expert+Design tabs
- `AppState.bootstrap()` clears stale persisted `mock-` optimization IDs so old local state cannot call live endpoints with mock identifiers
- Runtime service defaults are live-only via `RuntimeServices`; mocks remain available only through explicit tests/previews
- `RuntimeFeatures.isResumeLibraryEnabled = false` until the backend ships `/api/v1/resumes`; app shows saved resumes as unavailable instead of surfacing HTML 404s
- Design history is not loaded automatically because `/api/v1/styles/history` currently returns 500; Apply/Undo use the stable design endpoints without blocking normal preview/design navigation
- Upload preflight rejects missing, empty, unsupported, malformed, and no-readable-text PDFs before calling `/api/upload-resume`; readable PDFs are re-emitted as simple text-layer PDFs and multipart includes `resumeText` so the backend can fall back when parser internals fail
- Optimization detail now carries `contact`; iOS preview/copy uses real candidate identity and local fallback no longer fabricates placeholder contact values
- Design render/preview/export resolves backend template UUIDs to category+slug and iOS reloads current design assignment after Apply/Undo so Optimized reflects the applied template
- Design category switching is user-owned after the initial assignment load; subsequent category changes do not reload current assignment and cannot reset the UI back to the applied Traditional template
- Optimized preview starts rendering immediately from `optimizationId`; local section/contact HTML replaces the spinner as soon as details load, and cached backend design HTML can still upgrade the web view asynchronously
- Expert workflows accept user evidence input from iOS, parse backend-real structured outputs (summary options, quantified bullets, ATS keyword analysis, cover letters, screening answers), preserve selected variants for apply, let full rewrites apply selected sections, save applied reports to linked applications, and force no-cache optimized-section reload plus ATS score refresh when the backend returns a new score
- rb-aso-002 screenshot mode is launch-argument-only (`--marketing-screenshot --screenshot-slot N`) and renders App Store screenshot slots without changing the normal `RootView` path

## Key Wiring (2026-05-20)
- `ProfileView` now accepts `onSwitchTab` from `MainTabViewV2.switchTab` — "Send to Expert" / "Open Design" buttons in preview work from Me tab
- `ApplicationDetailView` now accepts `onSwitchTab` — passed through to `OptimizedResumeView` opened from application rows
- `ExpertModesViewModel` now takes `applicationId` — loads saved expert reports via `ApplicationTrackingService`; `ExpertSavedReportDetailView` fetches and renders individual saved runs
