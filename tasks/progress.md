# Project Progress

Project: ResumeBuilder iOS
Status: In Progress
Current Phase: Pre-release (TestFlight prep)
Active Story: —
Last Completed Story: Preview/design follow-up — optimized preview now paints local HTML immediately while backend design HTML loads, and Design category changes no longer snap back to Traditional (2026-05-25)
Next Recommended Story: Real-device smoke test optimize → optimized preview load → design category switching/apply → Expert apply with a known-good text-based PDF
Estimated Completion: 62%
Blockers: `/api/v1/resumes` returns production Next.js 404 HTML; backend route must ship before Resume Library can be re-enabled
Risks: Swift 6 concurrency strictness; PDF render via WKWebView (fragile on real device); no Hebrew/RTL support; live backend endpoint gaps now surface real user-visible errors instead of mock fallback content; ExpertSavedReportDetailView's run-id mapping depends on backend returning run IDs in /expert-reports (not yet verified against live backend)
Last Validation: XcodeBuildMCP `build_run_sim` succeeded and `test_sim` passed 33/33 on iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator after preview/category follow-up (2026-05-25)
Last Updated: 2026-05-25
Current Branch: iOS `main`; backend `fix/pdf-parse-xref-error`

## Tab Structure (as of 2026-05-20)
| Tab | Index | View | VM |
|-----|-------|------|----|
| Tailor | 0 | TailorView | TailorViewModel (stable @State) |
| Optimized | 1 | OptimizedResumeTabView → OptimizedResumeView | OptimizedResumeViewModel (built from appState.latestOptimizationId) |
| Design | 2 | RedesignResumeView | DesignViewModel (stable @State) |
| Expert | 3 | ExpertTabView → ExpertModesView | ExpertModesViewModel (built from appState.latestOptimizationId) |
| Me | 4 | ProfileView (with inline applications) | — |

## Key Shared State
- `AppState.latestOptimizationId: String?` — persisted via UserDefaults; set on optimize success AND when opening Latest Resume from Me tab or View Optimized Resume from Application Detail; drives Optimized+Expert+Design tabs
- `AppState.bootstrap()` clears stale persisted `mock-` optimization IDs so old local state cannot call live endpoints with mock identifiers
- Runtime service defaults are live-only via `RuntimeServices`; mocks remain available only through explicit tests/previews
- `RuntimeFeatures.isResumeLibraryEnabled = false` until the backend ships `/api/v1/resumes`; app shows saved resumes as unavailable instead of surfacing HTML 404s
- Design history is not loaded automatically because `/api/v1/styles/history` currently returns 500; Apply/Undo use the stable design endpoints without blocking normal preview/design navigation
- Upload preflight rejects missing, empty, unsupported, malformed, and no-readable-text PDFs before calling `/api/upload-resume`; readable PDFs are re-emitted as simple text-layer PDFs and multipart includes `resumeText` so the backend can fall back when parser internals fail
- Optimization detail now carries `contact`; iOS preview/copy uses real candidate identity and local fallback no longer fabricates placeholder contact values
- Design render/preview/export resolves backend template UUIDs to category+slug and iOS reloads current design assignment after Apply/Undo so Optimized reflects the applied template
- Design category switching is user-owned after the initial assignment load; subsequent category changes do not reload current assignment and cannot reset the UI back to the applied Traditional template
- Optimized preview paints local resume HTML as soon as sections/contact are loaded, then replaces it with cached backend design HTML when available instead of blocking the whole preview on the render-preview endpoint
- Expert workflows accept user evidence input from iOS and Expert Apply forces no-cache optimized-section reload plus ATS score refresh when the backend returns a new score

## Key Wiring (2026-05-20)
- `ProfileView` now accepts `onSwitchTab` from `MainTabViewV2.switchTab` — "Send to Expert" / "Open Design" buttons in preview work from Me tab
- `ApplicationDetailView` now accepts `onSwitchTab` — passed through to `OptimizedResumeView` opened from application rows
- `ExpertModesViewModel` now takes `applicationId` — loads saved expert reports via `ApplicationTrackingService`; `ExpertSavedReportDetailView` fetches and renders individual saved runs
